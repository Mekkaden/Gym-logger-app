# Gym Logger

A personal gym workout logging app built with React Native (Expo).

This project is primarily built for **my own personal use** to log workouts and track progress, while learning React Native through hands-on experimentation.  
It is not intended to be a finished or production-ready product.

---

## Overview

Gym Logger is designed for fast, offline workout logging with minimal friction during training sessions.  
The app structure and features reflect how I personally train and review my workouts.

The project continues to evolve as I improve my understanding of React, JavaScript, and React Native.

 ## Notes on Development



AI tools were used during development to assist with learning, prototyping, and understanding unfamiliar React Native concepts.

This project is AI-assisted and learning-driven. The focus is on experimentation, iteration, and understanding behavior by running and modifying the code, rather than claiming full manual authorship of every line.
